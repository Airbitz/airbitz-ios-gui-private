        Enter the value to Send in either the Bitcoin or fiat (ie. USD/EUR) currency fields. The alternate currency value will be automatically calculated based on the current exchange rate.<br>
        <br>
        Hit [Max] to send the maximum amount of money from your currently selected wallet. Note that the maximum amount may be less than the current balance due to transaction fees or prior unconfirmed transactions.<br>
        <br>
        If required, enter your withdrawal PIN or password and slide the button to the left to send your transaction.<br>
        <br>
        Note that the full balance of your wallet may not be available for withdrawal as prior transactions need to confirm before funds associated with them can be spent. Each transaction also requires a small transaction fee which reduces the total that can be sent from the wallet.
